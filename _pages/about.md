# Tathagata Srimani

Tathagata Srimani is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/" style="color:#0645AD;"><b>Carnegie Mellon University</b></a>, Pittsburgh, where he leads the NEXUS Research Group (NEXUS: Nanoelectronics EXpeditions for Ubiquitous Systems). Previously, he was a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/" style="color:#0645AD;">Stanford University</a>. He received the S.M. and the Ph.D. degree in EECS from <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/" style="color:#0645AD;">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in 2018 and 2022 respectively, and the B.Tech degree in E&amp;ECE from <a href="https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" style="color:#0645AD;">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a> in 2016. His research interests include demonstrations of circuits and systems leveraging new nanotechnologies, heterogeneous 3D integration, and technology-application-architecture co-design. 

His research results include the first silicon fab-compatible process for complementary Carbon Nanotube FETs (CNFETs) (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8591963" style="color:#0645AD;">IEEE TNANO 2018</a>, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.8b04208" style="color:#0645AD;">ACS Nano 2018</a>) which enabled the first CNFET RISC-V microprocessor (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586:019:1493-8" style="color:#0645AD;">Nature 2019</a>), and the first monolithic 3D system that integrates complementary CNFETs with silicon (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8776514" style="color:#0645AD;">IEEE Symp. VLSI Tech. 2019</a>, _Technology Highlight and Demo Session_). 

His work led to the transition of the first CNFET and CNFET + Resistive RAM (RRAM) ultra-dense (monolithic) 3D process in industrial silicon “fabs”: Analog Devices (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-020-0419-7" style="color:#0645AD;">Nature Electronics 2020</a>) where active product development is underway, and at SkyWater Foundry (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9265083" style="color:#0645AD;">IEEE Symp. VLSI 2020</a>, _Joint Technology and Circuits Focus Session_ & <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10185414" style="color:#0645AD;"> IEEE Symp. VLSI Tech. 2023</a>, _Technology Focus Session and Best Student Paper_) where CNFETs and RRAM are integrated at a 90nm node on 200mm silicon wafers as a foundry monolithic 3D technology (<a href="https://www.nano.gov/sites/default/files/pub_resource/NNI-FY24-Budget-Supplement.pdf" style="color:#0645AD;">highlighted in President's 2024 Nanotechnology Budget Report</a>). Following extensive fabrication and design advances, this CNFET + RRAM monolithic 3D stack can now achieve comparable performance (read power, write energy/latency, endurance, retention, multiple bits-per-cell) in the same footprint as conventional Front-End-of-Line silicon FET + RRAM stack fabricated on the same wafers, from the same foundry, at the same node (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10185414" style="color:#0645AD;">IEEE Symp. VLSI Tech. 2023</a>). Such CNFET+RRAM technology unlocks a large architecture design space with significant system-level energy-delay product (EDP) benefits(<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10137051" style="color:#0645AD;">DATE 2023</a>). 

He was a recipient of the MIT Presidential Fellowship in 2016 and Morris Joseph Levin Award—best Masterworks (S.M. thesis) presentation at MIT in 2018.
