# Tathagata Srimani

Tathagata Srimani is an incoming assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/" style="color:#0645AD;"><b>Carnegie Mellon University</b></a>, Pittsburgh starting January 2024. Currently, he is a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/" style="color:#0645AD;">Stanford University</a>. Previously, he received the S.M. and the Ph.D. degree in EECS from <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/" style="color:#0645AD;">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in 2018 and 2022 respectively, and the B.Tech degree in E&amp;ECE from <a href="https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" style="color:#0645AD;">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a> in 2016. 

His research interests include demonstrations of circuits and systems leveraging new nanotechnologies, heterogeneous and monolithic 3D integration, and technology-architecture co-design. His research results include the first silicon fab-compatible process for complementary Carbon Nanotube FETs (CNFETs) (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8591963" style="color:#0645AD;">IEEE TNANO 2018</a>, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.8b04208" style="color:#0645AD;">ACS Nano 2018</a>) which enabled the first CNFET RISC-V microprocessor (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586:019:1493-8" style="color:#0645AD;">Nature 2019</a>), and the first monolithic 3D system that integrates complementary CNFETs with silicon (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8776514" style="color:#0645AD;">IEEE Symp. VLSI Tech. 2019</a>, _Technology Highlight_). 

His work led to the transition of the first CNFET and CNFET monolithic 3D process to multiple industrial “fabs”: Analog Devices (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-020-0419-7" style="color:#0645AD;">Nature Electronics 2020</a>) and SkyWater Foundry (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9265083" style="color:#0645AD;">IEEE Symp. VLSI 2020</a>, _Joint technology and circuits focus session_ & IEEE Symp. VLSI Tech. 2023, _Technology focus session_). He was a recipient of the MIT Presidential Fellowship in 2016 and Morris Joseph Levin Award—best Masterworks (S.M. thesis) presentation at MIT in 2018.
